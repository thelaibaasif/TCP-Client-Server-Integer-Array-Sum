# TCP Client-Server Integer Array Sum

## Description
This project implements a simple TCP client-server connection in C. The client sends an integer array to the server, and the server computes the sum of the elements in the array and returns it to the client.

## Features
- TCP connection setup between client and server.
- Client sends an integer array to the server.
- Server computes the sum of the array elements.
- Server sends the computed sum back to the client.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler for C programming.
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thelaibaasif/TCP-Client-Server-Integer-Array-Sum/
   cd tcp-client-server-sum
